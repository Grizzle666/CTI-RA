abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Data mining techniques have numerous applications in malware detection. Classification method is one of the most popular data mining techniques. In this paper we present a data mining classification approach to detect malware behavior. We proposed different classification methods in order to detect malware based on the feature and behavior of each malware. A dynamic analysis method has been presented for identifying the malware features. A suggested program has been presented for converting a malware behavior executive history XML file to a suitable WEKA tool input. To illustrate the performance efficiency as well as training data and test, we apply the proposed approaches to a real case study data set using WEKA tool. The evaluation results demonstrated the availability of the proposed data mining approach. Also our proposed data mining approach is more efficient for detecting malware and behavioral classification of malware can be useful to detect malware in a behavioral antivirus.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The constant evolution of mobile devices' resour-ces and features turned ordinary phones into powerful and portable computers, leading their users to perform payments, store sensitive information and even to access other accounts on remote machines. This scenario has contributed to the rapid rise of new malware samples targeting mobile plat-forms. Given that Android is the most widespread mobile operating system and that it provides more options regard-ing application markets (official and alternative stores), it has been the main target for mobile malware. As such, markets that publish Android applications have been used as a point of infection for many users, who unknowingly download some popular applications that are in fact disguised malware. Hence, there is an urge for techniques to analyze and identify malicious applications before they are published and able to harm users. In this article, we present a system to dynami-cally identify whether an Android application is malicious or not, based on machine learning and features extracted from Android API calls and system call traces. We evaluated our system with 7,520 apps, 3,780 for training and 3,740 for test-ing, and obtained a detection rate of 96.66 {\%}.},

abstract = {Combating malware is very important for software/systems security, but to prevent the software/systems from the advanced malware, viz. metamorphic malware is a challenging task, as it changes the structure/code after each infection. Therefore in this paper, we present a novel approach to detect the advanced malware with high accuracy by analyzing the occurrence of opcodes (features) by grouping the executables. These groups are made on the basis of our earlier studies [1] that the difference between the sizes of any two malware generated by popular advanced malware kits viz. PS-MPC, G2 and NGVCK are within 5 KB. On the basis of obtained promising features, we studied the performance of thirteen classifiers using N-fold cross-validation available in machine learning tool WEKA. Among these thirteen classifiers we studied in-depth top five classifiers (Random forest, LMT, NBT, J48 and FT) and obtain more than 96.28{\%} accuracy for the detection of unknown malware, which is better than the maximum detection accuracy ({\~{}}95.9{\%}) reported by Santos et al (2013). In these top five classifiers, our approach obtained a detection accuracy of âˆ¼97.95{\%} by the Random forest.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A botnet is one of the most grievous threats to network security since it can evolve into many attacks, such as Denial-of-Service (DoS), spam, and phishing. However, current detection methods are inefficient to identify unknown botnet. The high-speed network environment makes botnet detection more difficult. To solve these problems, we improve the progress of packet processing technologies such as New Application Programming Interface (NAPI) and zero copy and propose an efficient quasi-real-time intrusion detection system. Our work detects botnet using supervised machine learning approach under the high-speed network environment. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) Build a detection framework using PF{\_}RING for sniffing and processing network traces to extract flow features dynamically. (2) Use random forest model to extract promising conversation features. (3) Analyze the performance of different classification algorithms. The proposed method is demonstrated by well-known CTU13 dataset and nonmalicious applications. The experimental results show our conversation-based detection approach can identify botnet with higher accuracy and lower false positive rate than flow-based approach.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {In computer security, protecting systems against malwares has become the main concern of particulars and companies. Unfortunately, the existing anti-malware systems are so fare unable to provide an efficient protection. However, a new generation of powerful malware detection techniques has emerged. One of these techniques is that based on the static analysis of the called API functions by a program in order to detect any suspicious behavior. In this paper we provide a method to extract existing associations between the imported API functions by malware codes under Microsoft Windows environment. The main goal of this work is to be able to determine with a high degree of confidence what the most likely used Windows APIs and their associations by malware are. We have used for that purpose a well known and a powerful statistical method which is the Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA). We applied the MCA method on a set of APIs which were priori extracted from a large dataset of malware and clean portable executable (PE) files. According to our knowledge, this is the first work having used factorial analysis to determine API associations in malwares. We assume that this allows a more accurate behavior based malware detection},

@article{Tahan2012,
abstract = {This paper proposes several novel methods, based on machine learning, to
detect malware in executable files without any need for preprocessing,
such as unpacking or disassembling. The basic method (Mal-ID) is a new
static (form-based) analysis methodology that uses common segment
analysis in order to detect malware files. By using common segment
analysis, Mal-ID is able to discard malware parts that originate from
benign code. In addition, Mal-ID uses a new kind of feature, termed
meta-feature, to better capture the properties of the analyzed segments.
Rather than using the entire file, as is usually the case with machine
learning based techniques, the new approach detects malware on the
segment level. This study also introduces two Mal-ID extensions that
improve the Mal-ID basic method in various aspects. We rigorously
evaluated Mal-ID and its two extensions with more than ten performance
measures, and compared them to the highly rated boosted decision tree
method under identical settings. The evaluation demonstrated that Mal-ID
and the two Mal-ID extensions outperformed the boosted decision tree
method in almost all respects. In addition, the results indicated that
by extracting meaningful features, it is sufficient to employ one simple
detection rule for classifying executable files.},
